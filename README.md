This is a submission for the [Kaggle What's Cooking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking). 
It was built to serve as a simple example of applied machine learning. 

**[See the post](https://technohedge.com/whats-cooking-sklearn/) for a full explanation and code overview.**

### Quick Start
1. Download the supporting files from Kaggle
2. Update filename variables in each of the `.py` files as needed
3. Run `parser.py` to take the training set from Kaggle and reformat it for our needs
4. Run `train.py` to train the model and generate predictions over the Kaggle test set
5. Run `kaggle.py` to reformat the predictions into the CSV reppresentation that Kaggle expects
